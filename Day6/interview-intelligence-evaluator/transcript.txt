Yeah, um, I think the CAP theorem is, like, you know, about choosing two out of three things in distributed systems — consistency, availability, and uh, partition something. So, yeah, it's important in designing systems that are, uh, like scalable.

For example, when building microservices, um, I would, you know, use load balancers to, like, distribute traffic. I think the load balancer helps with availability.

And, uh, yeah, sharding the database helps performance. I’m not exactly sure how eventual consistency works, but it’s used in NoSQL systems, right?

So, I’d say my system design is focused on like, scalability and some redundancy, yeah.
