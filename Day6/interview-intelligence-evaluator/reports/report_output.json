  "rag_summary": "Your understanding of AI agents and agentic AI is partially correct, but let's clarify the differences.\n\n**AI agents** are broader than just chatbots.  While chatbots *can* be AI agents, an AI agent is any software entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and acts to achieve goals autonomously.  This includes many systems that don't directly interact with humans through conversation.  Think of a program that automatically manages your email inbox by prioritizing messages or filtering spam \u2013 that's an AI agent.\n\n**Agentic AI** is a *type* of AI agent.  What distinguishes it is its ability to exhibit higher-order goal-directed behavior, often involving complex, multi-step tasks.  This includes planning, adapting to new information, using tools (like search engines or APIs), and even coordinating with other agents.  Agentic AI is indeed \"smarter\" in the sense that it can autonomously achieve more complex goals than simpler reactive AI systems.  Your comparison to a \"better\" Siri is apt in that it can handle more complex requests and adapt to changing situations more effectively.  The key difference is its capacity for independent, multi-step planning and execution.",
