AI Agents:
An AI agent is a software entity that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve specific goals autonomously. These agents can be reactive (responding to inputs), deliberative (reasoning with a model), or hybrid.

Key Properties of AI Agents:
1. Autonomy – operates without human intervention.
2. Perception – gathers data from the environment.
3. Reasoning – interprets data to make decisions.
4. Action – executes decisions to influence outcomes.
5. Learning – improves performance over time.

Agentic AI:
Agentic AI refers to systems that exhibit higher-order goal-directed behavior, often executing multi-step tasks independently. These systems can:
- Plan and adapt based on new information.
- Use tools like search engines, APIs, or memory.
- Coordinate with other agents or users to accomplish complex tasks.

Examples of Agentic AI include:
- Autonomous coding assistants
- Research agents using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Workflow orchestration systems (e.g., CrewAI, LangGraph)

Best Practices for Designing Agentic Systems:
- Use prompt engineering and memory to maintain context.
- Equip agents with tool-use abilities (e.g., calculators, web search).
- Ensure safe and bounded behavior through constraints and feedback loops.
