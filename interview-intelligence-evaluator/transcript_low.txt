So, um, AI agents are like, you know, chatbots or something that can kind of talk to people. I think they’re just tools that do stuff, like answer questions or whatever.

Agentic AI is, uh, like AI that has some goals or, you know, maybe it's smarter than normal AI? I saw a video on it once, I think it’s kind of like Siri but better, maybe?

They can, uh, like learn things and do stuff on their own, I guess? But I’m not really sure how they work or what makes them different from other AIs. I just know it’s a new thing.

Yeah, so I guess it’s like better AI that thinks more, or something like that.
